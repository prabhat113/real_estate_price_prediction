# real_estate_price_prediction
Real Estate Price Prediction is the process of estimating or forecasting the future prices of real estate properties, such as houses, apartments, or commercial buildings. The goal is to provide accurate property rates to buyers, sellers, investors, and real estate professionals to make informed decisions about real estate transactions.

Process I follow:
1. Gather relevant data from various sources, including real estate databases, government records, online listings, and other public or private sources.
2. Clean and prepare the collected data by handling missing values, removing outliers, and converting categorical variables into numerical representations.
3. Create new features or transform existing ones to capture important information that can influence real estate prices.
4. Explore and visualize the data to gain insights into its distribution, correlations, and patterns.
5. Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms or predictive models for the task.
6. Train the selected model on the training data, optimizing its parameters to make accurate predictions.


Clean data is crucial for accurate prediction :

1. Identify columns with missing values.
2. Decide how to address missing data, either by imputing with median/mode values or removing rows.
3. Use fillna() to replace null values with the median, mode, or other appropriate values. Alternatively, use dropna() to remove rows with missing data.


Standardizing ‘Total_sqft’ Data:

In the ‘total_sqft’ column, there are two issues: ranges and non-standard characters :

1. Correct the range values by calculating their averages. For example, if an entry is in the format ‘1000–1200 sqft,’ convert it to ‘1100 sqft’ for consistency.
2. Also handle non-standard entries, such as those with unusual characters or units. Convert these entries into float values to ensure uniformity.

Outlier Removal:

To ensure the accuracy and reliability of analysis, I need to address outliers — data points that deviate significantly from the norm. In my case, i am specifically concerned with outliers in the ‘total_sqft’ per bedroom and extreme price values.


Model Building
Machine learning models requires numeric data for their calculations. However, ‘location’ column contains categorical text data, which needs to be transformed into a suitable format for model input.

To bridge this gap between text data and numeric compatibility, i employ a technique known as one-hot encoding, also called “dummies.” In this technique, each unique ‘location’ category is transformed into a new binary column, where a ‘1’ signifies the presence of that category and ‘0’ indicates absence.

But i need to be careful because sometimes we end up with too many columns that are kind of the same. This is called the dummy variable trap. To avoid it, i drop one of those columns to ensure we have one less dummy column and add the rest to my data. Since i’ve already turned the location text into numbers, i can now get rid of the location column.


Train-Test Split:
Training Set: This portion is used to train model, allowing it to learn patterns and relationships within the data.

Testing Set: The testing set is held back and remains untouched during model training. It serves as an independent dataset to assess the model’s predictive performance. In my data i take test size as 0.2 which means 20 percent of dataset will be the test sample and 80 percent will be used for training the model.



Importance of ML in Real Estate:
1. Enhanced Accuracy: Machine learning looks at lots of data to make very accurate predictions about property prices, which helps both buyers and sellers. For buyers, this means better insights into fair market values, helping them make informed decisions. Sellers, on the other hand, can price their properties more competitively to attract potential buyers, ultimately reducing listing times and minimizing losses.

2. Data-Driven Decisions: Real estate professionals can leverage ML algorithms to gain deep insights into market trends and property values. By examining historical and real-time data, they can make more informed decisions, such as when to invest, sell, or renovate.

3. Efficient Valuations: Property valuation is a critical aspect of the real estate industry. ML algorithms excel at automating this process, making it quicker and more accurate. This streamlines the transaction process, reduces delays, and ensures that buyers and sellers have a clear understanding of a property’s fair market value.

4. Personalized Recommendations: By analyzing user preferences, budgets, and past behaviors, these systems suggest properties that closely match their criteria. This not only simplifies the search process but also enhances the overall user experience.

Applications of ML in Real Estate:
1. Price Prediction: Machine Learning can predict property prices by analyzing a variety of factors, such as location, property size, historical sales data, and more. Based on those data, it can give an estimated price prediction to give an insight of the market worth.

2. Property Valuation: Machine Learning automates and refines this process by analyzing extensive data sets and variables to determine a property’s true worth.

3. Fraud Detection: Machine Learning can be employed to detect irregularities and anomalies in real estate deals. By analyzing data patterns, it can flag suspicious transactions, helping to identify potential fraud and ensuring a safer environment for real estate transactions.

4. Investment Planning: ML algorithms can analyze various factors, including property performance data, market trends, and economic indicators. This analysis provides valuable insights into which properties are likely to yield the best returns. Investors can use this information to strategize and optimize their real estate portfolios, maximizing their potential for profit.


Conclusion
My journey through the intricacies of real estate price prediction has been both enlightening and rewarding. I embarked on this expedition with the goal of crafting a system that could demystify the complexities of property valuation using machine learning algorithm. Along the way, I navigated through data collection and preprocessing, uncovered hidden insights during exploratory data analysis, and carefully selected the most promising features. I embraced model selection and validation techniques, ensuring that my predictions are not just accurate but also robust and reliable.
